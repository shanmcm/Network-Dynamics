# Network-Dynamics
This repository is a collection of exercises on Graphs.

* In <b>Part1</b> you can find find exercises on connectivity and network flows and user equilibria in traffic networks applied to the LA highway network.
* <b>Part2</b> deals with opinions dynamics and convergence to consensus. Markov chains are also used to simulate the movement of particles in a network.
* <b>Part3</b> addresses simulations of epidemics on graphs by means of the SIR Model, with the last exercise focusing on determining the parameters related to the Swedish H1N1 epidemic.

All simulations are written in Python and use the NetworkX library.
